# rec-waveguide-FEMsolver
This Matlab program calculates the electromagnetic field in a 2:1 rectangular homogeneous waveguide with 2nd order FEM, and displays the electric field in TM32 mode.
The mesh files Boundary.DAT, Coordinates.DAT Node Number.DAT are generated by Matlab PDE toolbox, initmesh command.
By running SecondOrderFEM.m, an electric field in TM32 mode will be created. All electric and magnetic field results are stored in the matrix eigenVectorsWithBoundaryTM.
